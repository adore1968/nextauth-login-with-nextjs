# NextAuth.js Login with Nextjs
In this project I learned how to do authentication and Authorization for my Nextjs applications using NextAuth.js, which is an npm module that allows you to create an API to authenticate users with OAuth, that is, it allows you to log in with Facebook, Google, Github and the rest. In this application I will use Github.
